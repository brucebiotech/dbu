# Software User Guide

dbu provides the functionality of a standard cmsis-dap debug unit.

The caveat on this is that this is only possible on the currently selected swd port.

This is because none of the existing tools, [e.g. openOCD](#using-dbu-with-openocd) support the commands to switch the active SWD port.

dbu will power-up with port 0 active.
